# Docker
Wtf is the big deal about this shit? Never understood its goal, but fuck it. A lot of employers pay you
if you understand how to work with it. So I will attempt to get the hang of it. 

I torrented the "Docker zero to Hero" course. It's given by some Spanish devops dude. Seems good.

There are 7 or so chapters. I'm going to watch each chapter and attempt to document what I learn from it here.

So docker enables you to deploy shit from containers, from what I understand, it means you can containerize
something and make use of it somewhere else as long as it has docker.

Seems cool, I could make some shit and put it in a container with dependencies and give it as an image(?).

I've heard it's more DevOps and less programming, but fuck it. No one seems to give a fuck about
the shit I create, so might as well see if this can make some shit possible.

## Chapter 1 Introduction
### 1.1 What is Docker?

He says Docker is a tool to create, deploy and run applications by using containers. 
The container is 1 package with all dependencies and shit. 

He shows himself ssh'ing into some server and deploying a docker image. Then destroys it soon after. 
Seems cool, instant deployment and instant removal, but doubt his image is anything heavy. 

He performs this line: 

`docker run -d -p 1010:80 nginx:alpine`

-d I guess means deploy and -p specifies port of the server. nginx is a webserver so I guess that is what
he deploys. 

He proves that it is running by typing in this:

`docker ps -l`

`-l` I assume means list them, but allah knows what `ps` means.

He removes it with this

`docker rm -fv id` 

the id was some CONTAINER ID he viewed with his list command. 
Don't know what `-fv` means, but fuck it, he'll tell me eventually

End of paragraph.

### 1.2 What is a container?
He's gonna paint, oh boy.

He says a Container is just a process which is isolated (in a sandbox) in what they call a **namespace**.

**namespace** is the id or the name of the process. 

Then he talks about something called **C groups**, they allow you to limit the resources like cpu power and such.
He says limit, but probably means control. Same thing I guess, but limiting a resource sounds weird to me 
if you try to spin it as a positive.
 
Here's the image he drew:

end of paragraph

### 1.3 What is an Image?
He recycles picture above ^

He says an image consists of layers. 
Every image starts with something he calls **Scratch**.

On top of it comes the operating system? He shows CentOs as the next layer so I assume that means he 
uses the libraries and other files from CentOs as a basis for his image?

In the next layer he puts in a process, in this case some Apache stuff. 

He calls this a Parent-Child relationship. A child can be a parent of another child who can also be a parent
and so on.

He puts up a fourth layer as a child of Apache, something called cache, probably just an example. 

Here's the image he drew:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rascalov/Rascalov.github.io/master/images/1.3ImageLayers.png" width="500" height="350">

end of paragraph

### 1.4 Containers vs virtual machines
He shows an image with showing container and vm properties. 

Virtual machines each have their own guest os. So resources are saved with 
containers. He claims the best thing about docker is that you could destroy the containers instantly.

Here's the image he referred to:

End of paragraph.

### 1.5 Basics of a Docker file. 
He refers back to the docker image. According to him, we need to make a docker file.
A docker file is a plain text file where you define the instructions to create your image.

According to him, the file usually starts like this:

FROM operating_system_name
RUN = install the software you want through the selected os' package manager.
CMD = the command to execute after container creation. 

This is all he says currently, more in the future.

The example file he gave:

end of paragraph.

### 1.6 Docker's architecture

He shows an image of a Docker host?

Docker host is anything that runs a docker server.  
The Docker host contains:

The docker daemon: the process that is started once you set up docker.

REST API: communication to the daemon

CLI: You typing commands to the API.

End of paragraph

### 1.7 Layering in Docker
He shows an image composed by layers. 
The instructions from last video could be considered layers. 
They are read only layers. Instead, you can create another layer on top of the 
desired layer. 

If you want to update it, you can create a new image starting from a specific layer.

So you basically version your images. 

He ends with this image:

So far Chapter 1 is very basic. But that's probably not a bad thing. His accent fucks 
up some words, but it's understandable with the generated subtitles.

End of paragraph.

End of Chapter 1. 

## Chapter 2 Ready, Let's head to the installation.
